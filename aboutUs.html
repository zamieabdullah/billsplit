    Medford, MA. <br>
    Zimm was an off-campus college student at Tufts who was tired of manually splitting the bill 
    between him and his housemates. Not only was it time consuming, it was also difficult to keep track 
    of who ate what. So he decided to create a calculator that he could use for himself. 
    He gathered several classmates: Eddy, Anesu, and Zamie and together they started Billsplit.
    What was once a program to just help themselves is now available to any college student who 
    is looking to split their grocery bill.
